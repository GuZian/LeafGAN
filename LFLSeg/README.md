## Implementation of the LFLSeg Module for Segmenting Leaf Area

![Teaser image](../media/Supplement_LFLSeg.png)
The above image shows the heatmap visualization of our LFLSeg on different scenarios (full leaf, non-leaf, partial leaf) with respect to the `full leaf` class.  
These heatmaps can be used as useful segmentation masks for training our LeafGAN model without the need of pixel-label data.
LFLSeg works well on different in-Ô¨Åeld images with complex backgrounds. 

### Extreme cases
When the images contain multiple and overlapping leaves, the LFLSeg fails to correctly segment the leaf area (last image of the `full leaf` cases).
However, we do not expect the input which contains multiple leaves to be the case since we assume the input of the disease classifier is a single leaf image in this study.

Also, LFLSeg may incorrectly detect `partial leaf` as `full leaf` if the `partial leaf` image has a different shooting distance than images in our training dataset (last column).
Applying data augmentation techniques such as random resize/scale is expected to increase the robustness of the model.

## Datasets
The key idea of the LFLSeg is the introduction of the `partial leaf` class. `Partial leaf` images are created from `full leaf` images. From one single `full leaf` image, we crop 9 patches to create 9 images for `partial leaf` class as follows.

Dataset will have 3 classes:
- `full leaf`: image that contains a full leaf
- `partial leaf`: image that contains a part of a full leaf
- `non-leaf`: image that does not contain any part of a leaf

For more details about how to create dataset, please refer to our paper.

Please provide a `.txt` file that contain training info with label as follow:
- `full leaf`: label as 0
- `partial leaf`: label as 1
- `non-leaf`: label as 2

## Train LFLSeg

```bash
python train_LFLSeg.py --train /path/to/train_data.txt --test /path/to/train_data.txt
```

After training, please replace the trained model path at line 91 of the [leaf_gan_model.py](https://github.com/IyatomiLab/LeafGAN/blob/master/models/leaf_gan_model.py#L91)
```
load_path = '/path/to/LFLSeg_model.pth'
```

## Test LFLSeg
